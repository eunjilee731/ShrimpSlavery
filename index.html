            <div class="content" style="display: none; margin-left:350px;">
              <p>Slaves forced to work for no pay for years at a time under threat of extreme violence are being used in Asia in the production of seafood sold by major US, British and other European retailers, the Guardian can reveal.</p>
              <br><p>A six-month investigation has established that large numbers of men bought and sold like animals and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand are integral to the production of prawns (commonly called shrimp in the US) sold in leading supermarkets around the world, including the top four global retailers: Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco.</p>
              <br><p>The investigation found that the world's largest prawn farmer, the Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, buys fishmeal, which it feeds to its farmed prawns, from some suppliers that own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves.</p>
              <br><p>Men who have managed to escape from boats supplying CP Foods and other companies like it told the Guardian of horrific conditions, including <span class="italic">20-hour shifts, regular beatings, torture and execution-style killings</span>. Some were at sea for years; some were regularly offered methamphetamines to keep them going. Some had seen fellow slaves murdered in front of them.</p>
              <br><p>Fifteen migrant workers from Burma and Cambodia also told how they had been enslaved. They said they had paid brokers to help them find work in Thailand in factories or on building sites. But they had been sold instead to boat captains, sometimes for as little as <span class="italic">£250</span>.</p>
              <br><p>"I thought I was going to die," said Vuthy, a former monk from Cambodia who was sold from captain to captain. "They kept me chained up, they didn't care about me or give me any food … They sold us like animals, but we are not animals – we are human beings."</p>
              <br><p>Another trafficking victim said he had seen as many as 20 fellow slaves killed in front of him, one of whom was tied, limb by limb, to the bows of four boats and pulled apart at sea.</p>
              <br><p>"We'd get beaten even if we worked hard," said another. "All the Burmese, [even] on all the other boats, were trafficked. There were so many of us [slaves] it would be impossible to count them all."</p>
              <br><p>CP Foods – a company with an annual turnover of $33bn (£20bn) that brands itself as "the kitchen of the world" – sells its own-brand prawn feed to other farms, and supplies international supermarkets, as well as food manufacturers and food retailers, with frozen or cooked prawns and ready-made meals. It also sells raw prawn materials for food distributors.</p>
              <br><p>In addition to Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco, the Guardian has identified Aldi, Morrisons, the Co-operative and Iceland as customers of CP Foods. They all sell frozen or cooked prawns, or ready meals such as prawn stir fry, supplied by CP Foods and its subsidiaries. CP Foods admits that slave labour is part of its supply chain.</p>
              <br><p>"We're not here to defend what is going on," said Bob Miller, CP Foods' UK managing director. "We know there's issues with regard to the [raw] material that comes in [to port], but to what extent that is, we just don't have visibility."</p>
              <br><p>The supply chain works in this way: Slave ships plying international waters off Thailand scoop up huge quantities of "trash fish", infant or inedible fish. The Guardian traced this fish on landing to factories where it is ground down into fishmeal for onward sale to CP Foods. The company uses this fishmeal to feed its farmed prawns, which it then ships to international customers.</p>
              <br><p>The alarm over slavery in the Thai fishing industry has been sounded before by non-governmental organisations and in UN reports.</p>
              <br><p>But now, for the first time, the Guardian has established how the pieces of the long, complex supply chains connect slavery to leading producers and retailers.</p>
              <br><p>"If you buy prawns or shrimp from Thailand, you will be buying the produce of slave labour," said Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International.</p>
              <br><p>The Guardian conducted dozens of interviews with fishermen, boat captains, boat managers, factory owners and Thai officials in and around various ports in Thailand. Thailand enjoys a prime position as the world's largest prawn exporter in a vast seafood-export industry estimated to be worth some $7.3bn. Through multinationals such as CP Foods, Thailand ships out roughly 500,000 tonnes of prawns every year – nearly 10% of which is farmed by CP Foods alone.</p>
              <br><p>Although slavery is illegal in every country in the world, including Thailand, some 21 million men, women and children are enslaved globally, according to the International Labour Organisation. These people may have been sold like property, forced to work under mental or physical threat, or find themselves controlled by their "employers". Thailand is considered a major source, transit and destination country for slavery, and nearly half a million people are believed to be currently enslaved within Thailand's borders. There is no official record of how many men are enslaved on fishing boats. But the Thai government estimates that up to 300,000 people work in its fishing industry, 90% of whom are migrants vulnerable to being duped, trafficked and sold to the sea. Rights groups have long pointed to Thailand's massive labour shortage in its fishing sector, which – along with an increased demand from the US and Europe for cheap prawns – has driven the need for cheap labour.</p>
              <br><p>"We'd like to solve the problem of Thailand because there's no doubt commercial interests have created much of this problem," admits CP Foods' Miller. The Guardian's findings come at a crucial moment. After being warned for four consecutive years that it was not doing enough to tackle slavery, Thailand risks being given the lowest ranking on the US state department's human trafficking index, which grades 188 nations according to how well they combat and prevent human trafficking.</p>
              <br><p>Relegation to tier 3 would put Thailand, which is grappling with the aftermath of a coup, on a par with North Korea and Iran, and could result in a downgrade of Thailand's trading status with the US.</p>
              <br><p>"Thailand is committed to combatting human trafficking," said the Thai ambassador to the US, Vijavat Isarabhakdi. "We know a lot more needs to be done but we also have made very significant progress to address the problem."</p>
              <br><p>Although the Thai government has told the Guardian that "combating human trafficking is a national priority", our undercover investigation unearthed a lawless and unregulated industry run by <span class="italic">criminals and the Thai mafia</span> – facilitated by Thai officials and sustained by the brokers who supply cheap migrant labour to boat owners.</p>
              <br><p>"The Thai authorities could get rid of the brokers and arrange [legal] employment," one high-ranking Thai official, who is tasked with investigating human trafficking cases, said on condition of anonymity. "But the government doesn't want to do that, it doesn't want to take action. As long as [boat] owners still depend on brokers – and not the government – to supply workers, then the problem will never go away."</p>
              <br><p>Human rights activists believe that Thailand's seafood-export industry would probably collapse without slavery. They say, there is little incentive for the Thai government to act and have called for consumers and international retailers to demand action.</p>
              <br><p>"Global brands and retailers can do so much good without bringing too much risk upon themselves by simply enforcing their supplier standards, which typically prohibit forced labour and child labour," said Lisa Rende Taylor of Anti-Slavery International. "And if local businesses realise that non-compliance results in loss of business, it has the potential to bring about huge positive change in the lives of migrant workers and trafficking victims."The Guardian asked the supermarkets to comment on our finding of slavery in their supply chains.</p>
              <br><p>All said they condemned slavery and human trafficking for labour. They all also pointed to systems of auditing they have in place to check labour conditions. Several retailers have joined a new initiative called Project Issara (Project Freedom) to discuss how they should respond and several attended a meeting in with the major producers in Bangkok at the end of last month at which slavery was discussed.</p>
              <br><p>Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said: "We are actively engaged in this issue and playing an important role in bringing together stakeholders to help eradicate human trafficking from Thailand's seafood export sector."</p>
              <br><p>Carrefour said it conducts social audits of all suppliers, including the CP factory that supplies it with some prawns. It tightened up the process after alerts in 2012. It admitted that it did not check right to the end of its complex chains.</p>
              <br><p>Costco told us it would require its suppliers of Thai prawn "to take corrective action to police their feedstock sources".</p>
              <br><p>A Tesco spokesperson said: "We regard slavery as completely unacceptable. We are working with CP Foods to ensure the supply chain is slavery-free, and are also working in partnership with the International Labour Organisation [ILO] and Ethical Trading Initiative to achieve broader change across the Thai fishing industry."</p>
              <br><p>Morrisons said it would take the matter up with CP urgently. "We are concerned by the findings of the investigation. Our ethical trading policy forbids the use of forced labour by suppliers and their suppliers."</p>
              <br><p>The Co-operative was among those saying it was already working to understand "working conditions beyond the processing level". "The serious issue of human trafficking on fishing boats is challenging to address and requires a partnership" in which it is actively engaged.</p>
              <br><p>The managing director of corporate buying at Aldi UK, Tony Baines, said: "Our supplier standards, which form part of Aldi's contractual terms and conditions, stipulate that our suppliers must comply with applicable national laws, industry minimum standards and ILO and United Nations conventions of human rights, whichever standard is more stringent.</p>
              <br><p>"These standards also require that suppliers do not engage in any form of forced labour and related practices. Aldi will not tolerate workplace practices and conditions which violate basic human rights."</p>
              <br><p>Iceland said it only sourced one line containing prawns from a CP subsidiary but it was pleased to note that CP was "at the forefront of efforts to raise standards in the Thai fishing industry".</p>
              <br><p>CP said in a statement that it believed the right thing was to use its commercial weight to try to influence the Thai government to act rather than walk away from the Thai fishing industry, although it is putting in place plans to use alternative proteins in its feed so that it can eliminate Thai fishmeal by 2021 if necessary. It said it had already tightened controls over the way its fishmeal is procured. While it recognises that workers on boats are exploited, it added that the Thai department of fisheries continues to deny that unregistered boats are a problem. "We can do nothing, and witness these social and environmental issues destroy the seas around Thailand, or we can help drive improvement plans. We are making good progress," it said.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h1 style="margin-top:20px; margin-left:-400px;">Slavery <span class="italic">still</span> a problem in Thai shrimp industry despite scrutiny</h1><sup style="margin-left: -610px;vertical-align: 20px; font-weight: bold;">2</sup></button>
  <div class="content" style="display: none;margin-left:150px;">
    <p>Facing international pressure for failing to stop human trafficking in the seafood trade, Thailand promised almost a year ago to compensate victims of slavery and industry leaders vowed to bring all shrimp processing in-house.</p>
    <br><p>That hasn't always happened. Instead, some formerly enslaved shrimp peelers have been deported. And some shrimp peeling sheds are being inspected and authorized to keep operating.</p>
    <br><p>Tin Nyo Win, who escaped slavery and alerted police to abuses, was deported to Myanmar this month, along with his pregnant wife and a half-dozen others, after being held almost a year in a Thai government shelter. Authorities said that although the couple were victims of modern-day slavery, they had illegally entered Thailand to begin with.</p>
    <br><p>"They don't treat us like humans. They treat us like dogs," Tin Nyo Win said hours before Thai authorities took them away. "They just try to bully those of us who are victims already."</p>
    <br><p>Nattamon Punbhochar at the Thai foreign ministry said the couple never requested compensation and were deported in accordance with a memorandum of understanding Thailand has with Myanmar.</p>
    <br><p>"They don't want any wages from their employer," he said. "They just want to return to their home."</p>
    <br><p>Win denies this. He said he is broke, tried to get compensated, and would have actually appreciated a decent job processing seafood in Thailand.</p>
    <br><p>The Associated Press also found that while some Thai companies that export shrimp to the U.S. have given formerly entrapped workers better jobs in-house, others still use middlemen who employ labourers in remote, guarded warehouses. That's despite industry vows to end outside shrimp processing by the end of last year after human trafficking was exposed in the sheds.</p>
    <br><p>Shed owners frequently break environmental, labour or safety laws. Seventy-five per cent of the 109 inspected so far this year were cited for violations, and 24 were ordered to close.</p>
    <br><p>Human-rights and media reports documenting abuse in Thailand's $7 billion annual seafood export industry have brought international pressure. Last year, the AP reported on <span class="italic">fishermen locked in a cage</span> on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina and traced their catch to Thailand, then on to the U.S., leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed.</p>
    <br><p>AP also focused on slavery inside the Gig Peeling shed outside Bangkok in Samut Sakhon, where Tin Nyo Win, 22, and his wife were locked inside and forced to work 16 hours a day, ripping guts, heads and tails off shrimp that entered supply chains of most major U.S. supermarkets and companies including Red Lobster, Whole Foods and Wal-Mart.</p>
    <br><p>Win was a whistleblower — he ran away and told police, who raided the factory and rescued more than 100 people.</p>
    <br><p>In response, the Thai government said victims and witnesses of human trafficking could stay and work in Thailand for up to one year while their cases were investigated. This year the U.S. State Department commended Thailand for reforms and took the country off a global human trafficking blacklist.</p>
    <br><p>Those Thai reforms — on paper — include paying whistleblowers like Win as much as $2,800, and providing victims compensation, education, employment and other assistance. Empty promises, said Win, who said he and his wife weren't even given food sometimes.</p>
    <br><p>Col. Prasert Siriphanapitat, Samut Sakhon deputy police commander, said five people including a shed owner have been charged in Tin Nyo Win's case. All are out on bail.</p>
    <br><p>Last year, facing a boycott over abuses, major seafood groups and certifiers decided to protect workers by moving all labour in-house, banning outsourcing of shrimp pre-processing. Yet dozens of pre-processing sheds continue to operate, doing work for at least some of those exporters.</p>
    <br><p>The shrimp-peeling sheds are hidden in plain sight. Some are large factories, others nothing more than a large garage. Labor advocates say workers can become mired in debt by paying for the jobs in the first place and then being charged room and board. There's little oversight to ensure they're not being forced to work.</p>
    <br><p>The AP recently visited a handful of Samut Sakhon shrimp sheds — some now rebranded as shrimp factories — buzzing with workers hand-peeling truckloads of shrimp on residential streets or behind walls.</p>
    <br><p>"We prepare many tons of shrimp here every day," said Boonchai Seafood director Taweesak Suralertrungson. "We're following rules 100 percent."</p>
    <br><p>Documents at Boonchai show it processes shrimp for May Ao Food Co., one of Thailand's leading exporters to the U.S. May Ao touts major U.S. importers as customers, including Aqua Star and H&N Foods International. May Ao's own "May Brand" shrimp has been sold at Kroger and other supermarkets.</p>
    <br><p>Boonchai on this day had 107 shrimp peelers who were gutting, deveining and tearing heads off shrimp in icy buckets; Taweesak said each is paid the daily minimum wage of 300 baht ($8.50). Standing in a cooled warehouse, workers in gloves, aprons and boots worked at stainless-steel tables.</p>
    <br><p>With new government oversight, Boonchai's workers this year got insurance, housing support and hourly pay, Taweesak said. But a colleague complained that once workers get legitimate papers, most leave.</p>
    <br><p>"They don't want to work in this wet and smelly place if they don't have to," said assistant Jamras Goyari.</p>
    <br><p>Boonchai's operations passed a government inspection. But the industry had vowed to eliminate middlemen.</p>
    <br><p>Shrimp peeled by Boonchai which enters the supply chains of seafood exported by May Ao carries the Global Aquaculture Alliance's Best Aquaculture Practicescertification - which says "peeling and heading of shrimp must occur in facilities owned by and completely controlled by" the processing plants. May Ao is also a member of the Thai Frozen Foods Association, which promised last year "to eradicate third-party pre-processing."</p>
    <br><p>Officials at May Ao and TFFA initially insisted that all shrimp peeling is in-house. When pressed, TFFA President Poj Aramwattananont said May Ao's factory is too small to handle all the labor. He said there's nothing illegal about pre-processing in independent warehouses, and that the media has unfairly singled out his industry.</p>
    <br><p>"We are not 100 percent clean. You will always find some problems, but those are rare," he said.</p>
    <br><p>Global Aquaculture Alliance president George Chamberlain said his organization is gravely concerned and asked for more details for further investigation.</p>
    <br><p>"Clearly, this is a difficult long-term issue, but we take it very seriously, and we are working hard on it," he said.</p>
    <br><p>At May Ao, an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media said that while Boonchai isn't "in-house," they are allowed to do business with each other because they are part of the same association. Boonchai officials said they weren't yet TFFA members but were taking steps to join.</p>
    <br><p>Clearly some Thai seafood exporters have improved working conditions. One of the biggest, Thai Union, opened a large, clean peeling warehouse at its packing and exporting facility. The 1,200 workers get subsidized meals and opportunities for bonuses.</p>
    <br><p>"I have more rights. I like it," said Thet Paing Oo, 23, a migrant from Myanmar having lunch in Thai Union's cafeteria. He said he spent six years working 15-hour shifts at shrimp sheds without a day off.</p>
    <br><p>Now his salary has increased, and he gets one day off a week.</p>
    <br><p>Yu Wa, 35, also from Myanmar, teared up at the memory of her previous shed, where she was locked inside and paid by the kilogram no matter how long the work took. Now she gets a daily wage.</p>
    <br><p>"Workers don't need to buy our gloves and uniforms. We have a shuttle pick us up for work," she said. "I am treated well and the boss is good. It's much better."</p>
    <br><p>Thai Union was among the companies found last year to be getting their shrimp peeled at Gig Peeling shed, where Tin Nyo Win and others were enslaved.</p>
    <br><p>Thai Union spokeswoman Whitney Small said Thai Union offered everyone at Gig positions, accommodations, food and money. She said none of those workers ended up at Thai Union. She didn't know why.</p>
    <br><p>Tin Nyo Win, reached by phone back in Myanmar, said life is difficult. They have no money, and his wife is about to give birth.</p>
    <br><p>When AP tried to call him back, a woman answered. She said he had pawned the cellphone to her. She didn't know where he had gone.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="margin-left:500px;"><h1 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:50px;">Thailand’s fishing industry is no longer on European watch list for illegal practices, including human trafficking</h1><sup style="margin-left: -355px;vertical-align: 24px; font-weight: bold;">3</sup></button>
          <div class="content" style="display: none; margin-left:450px; ">
            <p>Thailand on Wednesday welcomed a decision by the European Commission to remove the Southeast Asian nation from a list of countries warned over illegal and unregulated fishing.
            <br><p>In 2015, the world’s third-largest exporter of seafood received a “yellow card” – or warning from the European Union over unsustainable fishing practices – carrying the threat of a European ban on the exports. That move prompted a major crackdown by Thailand’s military government on illegal fishing and an overhaul of the industry.</p>
            <br><p>“There have been sacrifices and adjustment to the way fishing was conducted,” said Lieutenant General Werachon Sukondhapatipak, the deputy spokesman of the military government. “Thailand’s fishing industry at all levels has a responsibility to the environment and the world through more sustainable fishing practices in line with international standards.”</p>
            <br><p>The measures Thailand adopted ranged from new rules to vessel monitoring systems, as well as a satellite-based system of tracking the movements of fishing boats, enforced by the Royal Thai Navy.</p>
            <br><p>It also toughened labour regulations to combat human trafficking and ill-treatment of migrant workers, improving the situation of more than 300,000 citizens of neighbouring countries employed in the Thai fishing industry.</p>
            <br><p>“Since the yellow card was issued, the Commission and Thailand have engaged in a constructive process of cooperation and dialogue,” the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a statement on Tuesday announcing its decision. “This has resulted in a major upgrade of the Thai fisheries governance, in accordance with the international commitments of the country.”</p>
            <br><p>The European Commission now sees Thailand as “a new committed partner” in the fight against fishing practices that deplete global fish stocks and harm people who make their living from the sea, it added.</p>
            <br><p>Thai seafood exports stood at US$2.1 billion in 2017, Commerce Ministry data show, recovering to their 2014 level after a drop in 2015 to US$1.8 billion following the European Union warning. About 9.9 per cent of Thai seafood exports went to the European Union last year, versus 10.3 per cent in 2014, ministry data show.</p>
            <br><p>Thailand’s private sector also welcomed the EU decision, saying the reforms would benefit the fishing industry.</p>
            <br><p>“This will boost investment and confidence in Thai seafood exports in the international market,” said Poj Aramwattananont, the vice-chairman of the Board of Trade of Thailand.</p>
            <br />

          <div class="content" style="display: none; margin-left:100px;">
            <p>Thailand’s billion-dollar seafood export industry remains infested with human rights abuses despite government pledges to stamp out slavery in its fishing industry, according to research by Human Rights Watch.</p>
            <br><p>Four years after damning revelations of chattel slavery aboard Thai fishing boats linked to seafood exported and sold by major retailers around the world, a report says that rights violations in one of Thailand’s major export industries continue unabated, including forced labour and widespread human trafficking.</p>
            <br><p>For the report HRW conducted interviews with 248 current and former Burmese and Cambodian fishermen as well as Thai officials, boat owners, local activists and United Nations agency staff over a two-year period in all of Thailand’s major fishing ports.</p>
            <br><p>It documented how migrant fishermen from south-east Asia continue to be routinely trafficked on to fishing boats, prevented from leaving or changing employers, and are often not paid for their work or paid less than the minimum wage.</p>
            <br><p>“What the report found was that although this military government has taken more positive steps forward than the last, the reforms that have been put in place are still largely cosmetic,” said Brad Adams, director of Human Rights Watch in Asia.</p>
            <br><p>“Forced labour is routine. The workers we interviewed described being trafficked on to ships, trapped in jobs they couldn’t leave, physical abuse, lack of food, long hours and awful working conditions. The worst thing for many of them was not being paid – the psychological harm and final indignity was the hardest to bear.”</p>
            <br><p>Steve Trent, chief executive of the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), who has been working with the Thai government on its reforms, said the focus should also be on ensuring that those selling seafood to consumers take responsibility for ensuring supply chains are free from rights abuses.</p>
            <br><p>“There is no shadow of a doubt that widespread and very serious labour violations are continuing throughout the industry,” said Trent. “Buyers and retailers have failed comprehensively to play their part in finding a real solution.”</p>
            <br><p>He said the creation of the Sustainable Seafood Taskforce had failed to live up to its promises: the industry body, made up of supermarkets, buyers and retailers sourcing seafood from Thailand, was set up in 2015 to bring transparency and accountability to their supply chains.</p>
            <br><p>“Never in my career have I seen a process more focused on talking in hotel rooms in Bangkok rather than actually committing to using their influence to create real change,” he said.</p>
            <br><p>“I challenge any of the retailers selling Thai seafood to consumers to guarantee that products from Thailand are free from human rights abuses and illegal fishing. They have arguably more power than anyone else and they are failing to use it.”</p>
            <br><p>The Sustainable Seafood Taskforce did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
            <br><p>A major investigation by the Guardian in 2014 exposed brutal cases of slavery aboard Thai fishing boats feeding trash fish – inedible or infant species of fish to be ground into fishmeal – into the supply chain of prawns sold by supermarkets in the UK, Europe and United States.</p>
            <br><p>In 2015 the European Union imposed a “yellow card” on Thailand under its illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing framework, threatening to ban Thai fisheries imports if the government failed to clean up its fishing industry, including labour rights violations.</p>
            <br><p>The Thai government responded with a broad programme of reforms including new laws to regulate and improve working conditions, documentation and wages for migrant fishermen. A “port-in, port-out” (Pipo) system was also created to require boats to report for inspections, as well as limiting time at sea to 30 days.</p>
            <br><p>However, HRW said that although some progress had been made, the persistence of trafficking and forced labour on fishing boats illustrated that many of the reforms were cosmetic.</p>
            <br><p>The report said that the labour inspection regime was largely a “theatrical exercise for international consumption” and that in 2015 Thailand failed to find a single case of forced labour in inspections of 474,334 fishing crew.</p>
            <br><p>The group is now urging the European Union to continue using the IUU framework to keep the pressure on the Thai government to address trafficking and slavery at sea.</p>
            <br><p>“Although we understand that the IUU is designed to focus on fishing stocks and environmental issues, we’re really concerned that a move to address human rights concerns outside the IUU framework means that we will lose the only real effective tool that the EU had to address trafficking and forced labour in the Thai seafood industry,” said Adams.</p>
            <br><p>Luisa Ragher, deputy of the delegation of the European Union in Thailand, said that the EU is committed to working alongside the Thai government to tackle labour rights violations.</p>
            <br><p>“The government of Thailand has given high priority to this and put significant effort into addressing these problems. There are still shortcomings but progress has been made and we are confident of their commitment to improving things,” she said. “We are working intensively at opening up a broader discussion on labour rights that extends past fishing into other sectors.”</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="margin-left:500px;"><h1 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:50px;">The Shrimp Industry's Awful Issue of Slave Labor Continues To Plague It Today</h1><sup style="margin-left: -343px;vertical-align: 25px; font-weight: bold;">5</sup></button>
          <div class="content" style="display: none; margin-left:450px;">
            <p>A few years ago, bombshell investigations from the Associated Press and the Guardian uncovered a severe problem with our shrimp industry: slavery. While it seemed like corrective actions were being taken as a result, some recent follow-ups suggest that forced, unpaid labor is still being utilized to catch and process hordes of shrimp.</p>
            <p><br>According to Dominique Barnes, CEO of plant-based seafood company New Wave Foods, the problem particularly persists in areas of Southeast Asia. "[The region has] these big companies raising shrimp, and this volume is so high, they need people to process it quickly. And so they’ll entice people saying 'Hey, we have jobs for you, come down to our farm, we’ll pay you, you’ll be able to eat,'” she told Foodbeast. "And so people put in all of their resources to get to this farm and then when they get there, they don’t get paid and become slaves to the industry."</p>
            <br><p>Once there, reports of confinement, a lack of pay, and even torture of the boat's "employees" was widely found in the original reports. The allegations were so severe that Thailand, the focus of the articles, publicly committed to help free those in slave labor and initiated a series of reforms to prevent it from happening again. Former President Barack Obama even enforced a policy then banning the import of goods produced by slave labor after the AP series was published.</p>
            <br><p>The original investigations from AP and the Guardian, conducted and reported between 2014-2016, focused on Thailand, one of the biggest exporters of shrimp to the United States. NOAA data shows that 10% of all US shrimp shipments came from Thailand in 2017, making it the third-largest importer for the year. A brand-new follow up from Human Rights Watch, as reported by the Guardian, shows that the entrapment Barnes described still exists today. HRW's director in Asia, Brad Adams, called Thailand's reforms to shrimping "cosmetic," and although positive steps had been taken, the labor issues are continuing.</p>
            <br><p>"Forced labour is routine. The workers we interviewed described being trafficked on to ships, trapped in jobs they couldn’t leave, physical abuse, lack of food, long hours and awful working conditions. The worst thing for many of them was not being paid – the psychological harm and final indignity was the hardest to bear."</p>
            <br><p>The corporations that bring in the slave-harvested shrimp haven't exactly owned up when it comes to traceability, either. Last year, Costco got a lawsuit thrown out that said they knowingly purchased shrimp from boats that used slave laborers. The judge's reason? Costco had no legal obligation to publicly disclose that information on its packaging.</p>
            <br><p>"In general, 90 percent of our shrimp is imported from these farms that really have the worst practices," Barnes told Foodbeast, saying that there are "small, small farms" out there that do a decent job when it comes to sustainable and slavery-free shrimp. However, for the most part, the issues of forced labor and poor working conditions that plague Thailand's shrimp industry continue to fester.<p><br />

        <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="margin-left:300px;"><h1 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:50px;">Thailand needs neighbours’ help to stamp out slavery at sea in its multibillion-dollar fishing industry, says rights activist</h1><sup style="margin-left: -96px;vertical-align: 25px; font-weight: bold;">6</sup></button>
            <div class="content" style="display: none; margin-left:250px;">
            <p>Thailand’s crackdown on exploitation and slavery in its multibillion-dollar fishing industry will only succeed if its neighbours step up and adopt anti-trafficking laws, according to a labour rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize nominee.</p>
            <br><p>Thai fishing vessels are increasingly registering in nearby countries to avoid scrutiny of their treatment of migrant workers as Thailand boosts its laws on human trafficking, said local campaigner Patima Tungpuchayakul.</p>
            <br><p>Unlike Thai boats, foreign vessels are not required to undergo checks by officials when they enter or leave ports in Thailand, said the activist, who featured in a 2018 documentary Ghost Fleet about workers trapped in slavery in the industry.</p>
            <br><p>Thailand has introduced a raft of measures – from contracts for workers to tightened and new laws – to clean up the sector since 2015, when investigations revealed widespread abuses and the European Union threatened to ban imports from the country.</p>
            <br><p>“Nowadays there are many Burmese vessels unloading fish in Thailand, when three or four years ago they didn’t even exist,” Tungpuchayakul said ahead of Thailand’s anti-trafficking day on June 5.</p>
            <br><p>“If we [Southeast Asian countries] want to cooperate in anti-human trafficking efforts, we need to have similar laws,” she said, adding that some vessels were choosing to fish further away from Thailand to avoid the risk of being punished.</p>
            <br><p>Tungpuchayakul, 44, co-founded the Labour Rights Promotion Network Foundation – a Thai campaign group that helps migrant workers – and was nominated for the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for her work supporting thousands of victims of human trafficking.</p>
            <br><p>Thailand is home to about 610,000 modern slaves – about one in 113 of its 69 million people – according to the Global Slavery Index by the rights group Walk Free Foundation.</p>
            <br><p>In April, the country amended its anti-trafficking legislation to add “forced labour or service” as an offence, and last month issued a new law to address exploitation in the fishing sector.</p>
            <br><p>It has eliminated recruitment fees paid by workers, prohibited the practice of withholding identity documents and banned the use of underage workers, but labour rights campaigners say the reforms are not adequate and abuses persist.</p>
            <br><p>A study by the Environment Justice Foundation (EJF) into slavery at sea released on Wednesday found that migrant workers in Thailand are still widely abused as they do not understand their rights, and end up trapped by huge debts paid to labour brokers.</p>
            <br><p>An adviser to the Department of Fisheries did not dispute the findings of the EJF report, and said that labour exploitation was possible on about 4,000 small-scale fishing boats that are not required to undergo checks by the government.</p>
            <br><p>Thailand has a total of 10,500 registered commercial vessels, according to the adviser Thanaporn Sriyakul.</p>
            <br><p>“For the rest, I am confident that there is no rights violation because they are checked every time they leave the port to go fishing,” he said, referring to the 6,000-odd larger vessels.</p>
            <br><p>He said the government planned to install GPS-like systems on smaller boats to track them, in a bid to stamp out abuses.</p>
            <br><p>Yet Tungpuchayakul said labour exploitation still exists despite government checks because workers are afraid to speak out, and called for a third party to be involved in the process.</p>
            <br><p>“While we have good laws, we’re dealing with a problem that has existed for over 40 years, and there’s also an issue with enforcement,” she said. “There should be ways for fishermen to participate [in these discussions], report instances of abuse or engage in other … activities, rather than fishing for 16 hours a day.”</p>
